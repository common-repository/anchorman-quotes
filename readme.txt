== Description ==

"Anchorman Quotes" is a slight modification of the "Hello, Dolly" plugin that comes with Wordpress. When activated, it displays a random quote from Anchorman in the top right corner of the admin panel. This is one of the most quotable movie that's ever been made with many many funny lines.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `anchorman.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Laugh every time you write a new post

= Alternatively =
Install through the admin plugin menu in your wordpress blog

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why? =

Working off Hello Dolly and Never Gonna Give You Up I thought Anchorman would be a good addition to the admin panel stable of plugins.

= Will it work with "Hello, Dolly"? =

If you really want them both at once, edit your "anchorman.php" file and change the css "top" line to something else
